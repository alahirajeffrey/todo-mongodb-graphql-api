# Todo Graphql API

# Requirements

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Documents consist of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of documents and function which is the equivalent of relational database tables.
- [Graphql](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It simplifies the control of your entire application stack, making it easy to manage services, networks, and volumes in a single, comprehensible YAML configuration file. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration file.
